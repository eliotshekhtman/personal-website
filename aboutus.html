      About Us
    </h1>
    <p>
      The Cornell UnderLings (Cornell Undergraduates in Linguistics) is the undergraduate student group of the Cornell
      Department of Linguistics. It serves to seek unity in the body of linguistics majors and promote linguistics at
      the undergraduate level in the Cornell community and the broader academic community. We have weekly meetings in
      which
      members plan events and activities, discuss linguistics and share related information, and simply have fun
      chatting about classes and professors.
    </p>
    <p class="special">
      The Cornell UnderLings invites anyone who is interested in languages, language patterns, language usage, language
      change, or anything language-related to join us in McGraw Hall. You don't have to be in the linguistics major to
      experience be a part of the UnderLings! To hear about UnderLings events, join our listserv by emailing
