      <p>I'm interested in <b>learning theory for dynamic systems</b> with an emphasis on <b>fairness</b>, and am
        interested in
        pursuing graduate research in this field with the goal of eventually applying the knowledge and experience I
        gain in order to emphasize social welfare in deployed models and algorithms.
        Prior research in this field focused on the dynamics created by
        adversarial strategic users interacting with multiple services.
        <!-- a multi-learner setting where adversarial users could strategically choose how much to use each of several services.   -->

      <div class="content">
        <p>Real-world systems often involve some pool of users choosing between a set of services. With the increase in
          popularity of online learning algorithms, these services can now self-optimize, leveraging data collected on
          users to maximize some reward such as service quality. On the flipside, users may strategically choose which
          services to use in order to pursue their own reward functions, in the process wielding power over which
          services can see and use their data. Extensive prior research has been conducted on the effects of strategic
          users in single-service settings, with strategic behavior manifesting in the manipulation of observable
          features to achieve a desired classification; however, this can often be costly or unattainable for users and
          fails to capture the full behavior of multi-service dynamic systems. As such, we analyze a setting in which
          strategic users choose among several available services in order to pursue positive classifications, while
          services seek to minimize loss functions on their observations. We focus our analysis on realizable settings,
          and show that naive retraining can still lead to oscillation even if all users are observed at different
          times; however, if this retraining uses memory of past observations, convergent behavior can be guaranteed for
          certain loss function classes. We provide results obtained from synthetic and real-world data to empirically
          validate our theoretical findings.</p>

        <p>Diffusion models have achieved great success in modeling continuous data modalities such as images, audio,
          and video, but have seen limited use in discrete domains such as language. Recent attempts to adapt diffusion
          to language have presented diffusion as an alternative to existing pretrained language models. We view
          diffusion and existing language models as complementary. We demonstrate that encoder-decoder language models
          can be utilized to efficiently learn high-quality language autoencoders. We then demonstrate that continuous
          diffusion models can be learned in the latent space of the language autoencoder, enabling us to sample
          continuous latent representations that can be decoded into natural language with the pretrained decoder. We
          validate the effectiveness of our approach for unconditional, class-conditional, and sequence-to-sequence
          language generation. We demonstrate across multiple diverse data sets that our latent language diffusion
          models are significantly more effective than previous diffusion language models.</p>

        <p>Missing value imputation is crucial for real-world data science workflows. Imputation is harder in the online
          setting, as it requires the imputation method itself to be able to evolve over time. For practical
          applications, imputation algorithms should produce imputations that match the true data distribution, handle
          data of mixed types, including ordinal, boolean, and continuous variables, and scale to large datasets. In
          this work we develop a new online imputation algorithm for mixed data using the Gaussian copula. The online
          Gaussian copula model meets all the desiderata: its imputations match the data distribution even for mixed
          data, improve over its offline counterpart on the accuracy when the streaming data has a changing
          distribution, and on the speed (up to an order of magnitude) especially on large scale datasets. By fitting
          the copula model to online data, we also provide a new method to detect change points in the multivariate
          dependence structure with missing values. Experimental results on synthetic and real world data validate the
          performance of the proposed methods.</p>
